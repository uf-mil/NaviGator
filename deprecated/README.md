# NaviGator deprecated code
This directory contains libraries, scripts, and executables which have been abandoned, replaced, or no longer used.
These files are not compiled or tested, but remain temporarily in the repository for reference or future use.

Note: if code has been moved to mil_common, do not put it in the deprecated folder.

If you add files to the deprecated folder, please preserve the directory structure. For example,
perception/navigator_vision/2016_old_node.py should be moved to deprecated/perception/navigator_vision/2016_old_node.py
